# Wallclock

## Preface
This is my very first Python project. So be patient with my code please.
Purpose is to create a wall clock using a 64x64 LED panel with a Raspberry Pi. First idea was to use a RasPi Zero W but it seems it is not fast enough, so currently I am using a RasPi3.

## Structure
I decied to create widget modules for each item I want to display. Feel free to add, fork etc...
